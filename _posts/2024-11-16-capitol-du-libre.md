The Capitole du Libre is an incredible annual event that brings together open-source and free software enthusiasts from all walks of life.

As a long-time attendee, I’ve had the privilege of immersing myself in a community driven by a shared passion for open technologies.
Over the years, I’ve attended inspiring talks, exchanged ideas with like-minded individuals, and engaged in deep discussions with representatives from organizations like Wikipedia, Framasoft, and Firefox.

This year, I decided to take my involvement to the next level. 
With the support and partnership of my friend Mathieu, we stepped up to present two talks at this year’s conference. 
These presentations are close to my heart and reflect our shared dedication to open-source principles and tools.
Let me introduce the two topics we’ll be discussing:

1. Kubernetes and Containers: The Hidden Iceberg Beneath

Kubernetes is often heralded as the gold standard for container orchestration. 
However, it's essential to recognize that Kubernetes is merely the tip of the iceberg in the vast sea of open-source container technologies. 
Beneath the surface lies a diverse and intricate ecosystem of tools and components that make containerized workloads possible.

In this session, we aim to take the audience on a deep dive "below the surface" of Kubernetes. 
We'll explore the critical building blocks that enable containers to function, from the kernel-level mechanisms in Linux to the variety of runtime alternatives that exist beyond the default standards. 
By shedding light on these often-overlooked components, we hope to equip attendees with a better understanding of the architecture and flexibility available within the container ecosystem.

2. DevOps: Choosing a Free and Open-Source Stack for Production

Even for personal or small-scale projects, adopting DevOps principles can transform how we collaborate, deploy, and manage applications. By fostering collaboration, accelerating deployments, and automating workflows, DevOps enables us to deliver more reliable applications efficiently.

However, building a DevOps pipeline with a focus on open-source tools can be daunting. With the sheer number of tools available—many championed by industry giants like Red Hat and Microsoft—it’s challenging to identify a stack that stays true to open-source values while meeting practical needs.

In this talk, we share our journey of building a complete DevOps pipeline, focusing exclusively on free and open-source tools. 
From code versioning and hosting to CI/CD, we’ve carefully evaluated, chosen, and implemented a stack that aligns with the principles of openness and collaboration. 
We’ll walk the audience through our decision-making process, discuss the trade-offs we encountered, and demonstrate a live implementation of the stack we built.
