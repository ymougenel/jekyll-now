Brown Bag Lunch Kotlin presented for a client: language principles & migration strategy
<!--more-->

Few months after I tried Kotlin on personal projects, my company considered migrating few applications from Java to Kotlin.
I tried through my presentation to answer the following questions:
* Why so much hype for this new language?
* What are the core concepts?
* How to migrate from Java to Kotlin?

_*Note*_: regarding the migrating, I since contributed to [this great IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10862-vcs-kotlin-converter): it saves the VCS history during the Kotlin migration.
