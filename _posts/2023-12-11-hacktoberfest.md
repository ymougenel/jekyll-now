I joined the 2023 Hacktoberfest event, and ended up with 3 contributions:
* [A bug fix](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/pull/929) on the **Jenkins Slack-plugin**
* [A small enhancement](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/pull/1492) on the **spring-boot initializr project**
* [A translation fix](https://github.com/jenkinsci/text-finder-plugin/pull/206) for the **"text-finder" Jenkins plugin**

It's been a while since I participated in the Hacktoberfest open-source  events.  
This year I came with few goals and quite little time, here is how it went:

# The event
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) happens every year in October, it is a free event which encourages open-source contribution. 
I participated in the 2017 event, and wanted to try it again this year.

# Goals for this year
As I started a new job on September, I had little time (and energy) left during October. 

Therefore my strategy was simple: 
* Find existing OS issues that do not require a huge onboarding. 
* Focus on Java & Python, which are my main programming languages.


I spent some time searching on projects on Github & Gitlab (both platforms provides a Hacktoberfest Topic gathering projects).
Here comes the concluding contributions:

# Jenkins __Slack-Plugin__: a pipeline status error
On my current job we use the Slack/Jenkins plugin, which send pipeline status and messages on Slack.  


When I noticed [this existing issue](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/issues/818) regarding a pipeline error not setting the right build status, 
I thought I could give it a try: I had already worked on Jenkins plugins before, and was vaguely familiar with the pipeline status behaviour:

1. Reproduce the bug: I set up a new Jenkins dockerized environment, re-used an old Slack account, built and deployed the plugin on it.
2. Isolate the concerned code base . Jenkins' plugins usually works through steps. The faulty steps had to identified and fixed.
3. Testing: I manually tested few scenarios, and added **unit tests** to avoid any further regressions.

# Spring-io initializr: Changing the zip file name
As I participated on an open-source coding night at [Takima](https://www.takima.fr/), I searched for small issues related to the Spring Framework.  
[This one](https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io/issues/163) caught my eye: the zip name generated by Spring Initializr sometimes didn't match the project artefact ID.  
After compiling a huge codebase (both start.spring.io and Initializr), fixing it only meant keeping track of the naming process for the artefactId and the zip file, and merging those.

[Github MR](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/pull/1492), status: accepted & closed, time spent: ~2 hours

# Text-finder Jenkins plugin, a translation contribution that became a fix
Back in the old days, I started my open-source journey by doing some Jenkins plugin French translations.  
Due to the lack of time, I decided that my last MR would be i18n and found an interesting Jenkins plugin already in English and Japanese, but not in French.

However, while translating in French I noticed that the plugin did not have the right translation folder structure, which implied that the Japanese translations were mostly ignored.


I re-arranged the structure in order to have all the translations taken into account.  
It implied way more time than I expected (finding the right structure and testing for all the languages), but it finally worked...

[Github MR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/text-finder-plugin/pull/206), status: accepted & closed, time spent: ~3 hours
