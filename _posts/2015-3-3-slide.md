title: Slide! A platform 2D java game
---

A nice JSFML game made years ago. With many levels, graphisms and mechanics.

Made during our student years with a friend, Slide is an extra-curricular project.
We enjoyed building it and apply our new Oriented Object knowledge.

The game includes around twelve levels, among with created sprites and design!
