# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependancies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog ([**Theme Demo**](http://jekyllnow.com)) and can spend more time making your blog awesome!

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to YourGitHubUsername.github.io. 

Your Jekyll blog will then be live at that URL: <http://YourGitHubUsername.github.io> (it's generally live immediately, but can occasionally take up to 10 minutes)

### Step 2) Customize your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. 

You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too!

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy.

To add additional posts you can hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
