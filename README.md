## 5 Minute Blog Setup on GitHub Pages

#### 1) Fork Jekyll Boilerplate

Click the fork button at the top right of the repository. 

#### 2) Rename it to be your GitHub user site

After forking, click the Settings button on your new repository and change the repository name to username.github.io -- make sure that username is replaced with your GitHub username! 

#### 3) Your blog is live!

You can now go to http://username.github.io and you'll see your site live! This can take up to 10 minutes to update, but often it's there right away. 

#### 4) Customize your blog

You can input your details by simply editing the configuration file. Go to the base directory and open up _config.yml. In there you'll be able to input your:

- Blog name
- Description
- Avatar
- Social links
- Disqus comments code
- Google Analytics code

#### 5) Publish your first post

Go to the _posts folder and simply edit the one that's there to create your first blog post! Jekyll pulls the date of the post from the filename, so you can edit that to today's date. 

#### Set up your own domain name

Follow the latest [GitHub Pages Custom Domain Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) to set up your custom domain name. I've created the CNAME file already, so that you can easily edit it within the repository. 

#### Publishing New Content

Alternative flow for publishing content, without needing Local Development Environment

## Customizing The Theme

#### Local Development 

#### 1) Install Dependancies
