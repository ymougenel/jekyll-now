## More things you can do without touching the command line

#### Publish new content

To publish new blog posts, go into the _posts folder and click the New File button. Name your post in this format: year-month-day-Title.md, save it, and you're set! 

(You can also publish new content via command line by git cloning down your repo, and pushing up your new markdown files)

#### Set up your domain name

Follow the latest [GitHub Pages Custom Domain Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) to set up your custom domain name. I've created the CNAME file already, so that you can easily edit it within the repository.
