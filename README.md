# Jekyll Now

Create your Jekyll blog in minutes, without touching the command line.

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork to your User Repository

With this fork first setup you can get a feel for what Jekyll is like extremely quickly. Fork this repo, then make sure that you rename your fork to yourgithubusername.github.io. Your Jekyll blog can then immediately be viewed at that URL.

### Step 2) Customize your site

You can now edit your site name, gravatar and other options using the _config.yml file.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Your site is customized and looking great. Now you just have to write that epic blog post! We're going to edit the existing Hello World post for your first post.

To add additional posts you can hit the + icon in the _posts folder (shown at the end of the video) to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
