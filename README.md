# Jekyll Now

Create your Jekyll blog in minutes, without touching the command line.

## Setup

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now

With this fork first setup you can get a feel for what Jekyll is like extremely quickly. Make sure you use YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io instead of souploaf.github.io!

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Your site is customized and looking great. Now you just have to write that epic blog post! We're going to edit the existing Hello World post for your first post.

To add additional posts you can hit the + icon in the _posts folder (shown at the end of the video) to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
